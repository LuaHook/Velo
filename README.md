# Velo
Velo allows encrypted (secure) communication through use of RemoteEvents and RSA encryption.

# How it works
We use the same type of encryption as HTTPS, making Velo inheritly secure.

# Security
Velo was built to assist with network security, not offer a full solution. Therefor, Velo helps mitigate network-based attacks but doesn't prevent them. 
We made Velo as secure as possible to mitigate the risk of these attacks but unfortuntely there is no way to prevent them. We suggest that before deploying Velo, you protect and obfuscate our code.
